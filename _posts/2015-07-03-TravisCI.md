[<span style="color: blue">Travis CI</span>](https://travis-ci.org) is a continuous integration tool.

You log in using your [<span style="color: blue">GitHub</span>](https://github.com) credentials and then connect it to one or more of your repos.

Then, every time you commit to a repo, Travis CI will spin up a [<span style="color: blue">VM</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) (that you configure) and run your [<span style="color: blue">regression tests</span>](https://github.com).

Configuring the VM makes it very clear what dependencies your software has.
