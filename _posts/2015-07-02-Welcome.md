Started a blog today using [<span style="color: blue">GitHub Pages</span>](https://pages.github.com).

It's powered by [<span style="color: blue">Jekyll</span>](http://jekyllrb.com).

Got it up and running with [<span style="color: blue">Jekyll Now</span>](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

I have a local clone of the repo.

I edit posts locally using [<span style="color: blue">Markdown</span>](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), I commit to the repo, and the posts appear automatically at [<span style="color: blue">GitHub</span>](https://github.com).
