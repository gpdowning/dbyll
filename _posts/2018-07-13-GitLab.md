In both of my classes, *CS371p: Object-Oriented Programming* and *CS373: Software Engineering* I've had my students use *source control*, *containerization*, and *continuous integration* for some time.

For source control I've been using [git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com), for containerization I've been using [Docker](https://www.docker.com), and for continuous integration I've been using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)

In June of this year, [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) acquired GitHub, which led to the exodus of many developers.

I wanted to see what else was out there and came upon [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).

GitLab is very similar to GitHub in many ways, but it has one outstanding feature, which is that continuous integration is built-in.

Furthermore its continuous integration offering makes use of Docker, which is an additional advantage.

With GitHub, Docker, and Travis CI, I needed to configure Docker and Travis CI in very similar and therefore redundant ways.

An example `.travis.yml` file for Python was:

```
language: python

python:
   - "3.6"

install:
    - pip install autopep8
    - pip install coverage
    - pip install mypy
    - pip install numpy
    - pip install pylint

script:
    make
```

And an example `Dockerfile` file for Python was:

```
FROM python:3

RUN pip install autopep8      && \
    pip install coverage      && \
    pip install mypy          && \
    pip install numpy         && \
    pip install pylint

CMD bash
```

Furthermore, `.travis.yml` doesn't accommodate multiple languages.

GitLab CI, on the other hand, is configured precisely by relying on Docker!

So, now:

`Dockerfile` for Python:

```
FROM python:3

RUN pip install autopep8      && \
    pip install coverage      && \
    pip install mypy          && \
    pip install numpy         && \
    pip install pylint

CMD bash
```

`Dockerfile` for JavaScript:

```
FROM node

RUN npm install    assert   && \
    npm install    lodash   && \
    npm install -g istanbul && \
    npm install -g jshint   && \
    npm install -g mocha

CMD bash
```

And now, `gitlab-ci.yml` makes use of both:

```
node:
    image: gpdowning/node
    script:
    - make

python:
    image: gpdowning/python
    script:
    - make
```
