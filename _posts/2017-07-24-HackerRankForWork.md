This is a followup to my previous post about [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com).

With a regular [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com) account, when my students submit a solution to a challenge in a contest, I can **not** see my student's solution. I only know that [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com) has confirmed that their solution passed my tests.

In the context of a programming project, I don't care about that, because I only award half of the credit of the assignment based on the correctness of the solution. Students separately submit their solution through GitHub for many other types of assessment: design, documentation, efficiency, style, etc.

But, I'm also using [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com) now in the context of exams. In the context of an exam, if I can create the usual type of HackeRank question, one that reads from stdin and writes to stdout, and can create good tests, then again, I don't really need to see the code.

As an example, one of my [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com) exam questions is to implement root mean squared error. It's easy enough to create many tests for that.

But, there are also questions that I'm interested in giving that require the writing of a function or a class that exhibits some kind of behavior that has nothing to do with reading or writing anything.

Then, I need to provide some code that would test the student-written code, I need to be sure the student doesn't change my test code, and I need to see the student's code to confirm that they haven't simply hardwired results that would fool my tests.

For all of that there is [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank for Work</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com/work/)!

That's the kind of account that companies buy so their recruiters can evaluate prospective software engineers.

The great news is that a [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank for Work</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com/work/) account is **free** for education purposes. You just have to request it.

With that kind of account I can create code stubs that students can **not** edit and once submitted I can see the code of the submission.

This has been huge in my ability to now create electronic exams that test coding ability.
