Discovered that the same workflow used with [<span style="color: blue">Jekyll Now</span>](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) can be used with many [<span style="color: blue">Jekyll Themes</span>](http://jekyllthemes.org).

I'm now using [<span style="color: blue">Dbyll</span>](https://github.com/dbtek/dbyll).
