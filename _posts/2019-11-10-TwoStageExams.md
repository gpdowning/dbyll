[Eric Mazur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Mazur), a physics professor at Harvard, since '90, is credited with popularizing **the flipped classroom** with the publication of his book [Peer Instruction](https://www.amazon.com/Peer-Instruction-Manual-Eric-Mazur/dp/0135654416/) in '97.

[Carl Wieman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wieman), Nobel Laureate in physics, '01, furthered Mazur's work with the creation of the [Carl Wieman Science Education Initiative (CSWEI)] at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia) in '97.

I wanted to share with you some teaching tool ideas.

In both of my classes, *CS371p: Object-Oriented Programming* and *CS373: Software Engineering* I've had my students use *source control*, *containerization*, and *continuous integration* for some time.
