[<span style="color: blue">Top Hat</span>](https://tophat.com) is a classroom and student response system.

I'm using it to take attendance and to give daily multiple-choice in-class quizzes.

The students can respond on their website or with a smartphone app or via an SMS text.

The quizzes are then auto-graded.

The results of the attendance and the quizzes are then available on their website.

It's free for the instructor.

There is a nominal fee for the student.
