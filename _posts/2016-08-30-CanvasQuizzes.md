I create daily quizzes on Canvas.

When I do there are several settings that I choose.

It gets tedious to re-choose those settings every time I create a new quiz.

Instead, I create a blank quiz with those settings, but no content, yet, and then export that quiz.

I later import that blank quiz and just fill in the content.
