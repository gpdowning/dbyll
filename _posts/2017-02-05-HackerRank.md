I am enamored with HackerRank!

[<span style="color: blue">HackerRank</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com) is an online judge, similar to [<span style="color: blue">Codeforces</span>](http://codeforces.com), [<span style="color: blue">Kattis</span>](https://open.kattis.com), [<span style="color: blue">Sphere</span>](http://www.spoj.com), and [<span style="color: blue">UVa</span>](https://uva.onlinejudge.org).

All of these have the following in common:

* a large set of challenges ([<span style="color: blue">ACM-ICPC</span>](https://icpc.baylor.edu)) like problems)

* contests

* a variety of languages can be used to solve the challenges

* a global leaderboard

Features that are somewhat unique to [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com) are:

* it's being used by many companies to screen prospective employees

* challenges are categorized by type (e.g. dynamic programming)

* a submission is given several tests, you're told how many tests failed and how many succeeded, and receive a grade accordingly

* you can create your own contests with [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com) challenges or your own challenges with leaderboards just for your students

I've successfully run two contests for my students this term, one with a [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com) challenge and another with a UVa challenge that I copied, and for which I have several test cases.

So, if you have a programming project that only reads ASCII from stdin and only writes ASCII to stdout, and for which you have several test cases, I think it's very attractive to create a [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com) contest with either [<span style="color: blue">HackerRank</span>](https://www.hackerrank.com) challenges or your own.
