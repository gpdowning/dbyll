> “If you ask someone else for help on a problem in an exam you are cheating, but if you don’t ask someone for help on a problem in the real world, you are a fool.” -- Dan Schwartz, Stanford Graduate School of Education

[<span style="color:blue">Eric Mazur</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Mazur), a physics professor at Harvard, since '90, is credited with popularizing [<span style="color: blue">the flipped classroom</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) with the publication of his book [<span style="color: blue">Peer Instruction</span>](https://www.amazon.com/Peer-Instruction-Manual-Eric-Mazur/dp/0135654416/) in '97.

[<span style="color: blue">Carl Wieman</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wieman), Nobel Laureate in physics in '01, furthered Mazur's work with the creation of the [<span style="color: blue">Carl Wieman Science Education Initiative (CSWEI)</span>](http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca) at the
[<span style="color: blue">University of British Columbia (UBC)</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia) in '97.

One of the concrete pedagogical tools to come out of that work is a relatively simple way to introduce [<span style="color: blue">collaborative learning</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_learning) and [<span style="color: blue">formative assessment</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formative_assessment) into an exam.

[<span style="color: blue">Two-stage exams</span>](http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/files/Two-stage_Exams.pdf) consist of two stages:

1. Individual, between 2/3 and 3/4 of the examination time; a standard formal examination that students complete working alone.

2. After students turn in their individual exams, small groups solve similar or identical problems during the remainder of the examination time.

Students’ response to the use of two-stage exams is overwhelmingly positive. In response to a survey, 87% of the students recommended their continued use.
