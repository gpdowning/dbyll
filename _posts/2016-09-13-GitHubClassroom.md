I want to be known as the king of software-development tools!!!

Just discovered [<span style="color: blue">GitHub Classroom</span>](https://classroom.github.com).

Iâ€™ve been having my students develop and submit their software to me via git and GitHub for several years.

Students can apply to GitHub for an educational account which will give them unlimited private repos.

In the past I would then have the students invite the graders and me as collaborators, so that we could then clone their repo and grade it.

GitHub classroom makes that last step unnecessary.

You create a GitHub Organization, attach it to [<span style="color: blue">GitHub Classroom</span>](https://classroom.github.com), and then apply for a discount on repos for that organization.

I got the discount in about a day, and I now have unlimited private repos in that organization for my students.

The graders and I are now automatically co-owners with the students of all the repos, and we can now avoid the hassle of getting many, many requests for collaboration.
